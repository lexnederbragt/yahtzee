# yathzee

A quiz on Facebook once asked:

> Task: in 5 dice yahtzee game, what is the chance of getting a yahtzee (5 similar dice), ignoring all other options (straight, etc)"

These notebooks attempt to answer this question. In the process, I inadvertently solved the problem using Monte Carlo Simulation (which I always thought was something magical :-) )
